Proceeding from this consideration, one may perhaps venture to ask: Mightn't walking erect, in general, have appeared earlier in men than in women? In that case, the woman would have been the four-footed companion of the man, as the dog or cat is today. And it seems only a step from this conception to the idea that  the frontal encounter of the two partners in coitus would have been originally a kind of perversion; and perhaps it was by way of this deviance that the woman would have begun to walk upright.
